🧠 Phronesis
A Provably Safe Language for Agentic Ethical Reasoning
Author: Jonathan D. A. Jewell Version: Standard Candidate 1.0
Repository: https://gitlab.com/hyperpolymath/phronesis
🌐 Overview
Phronesis is a neuro-symbolic agentic language designed to formalize ethical reasoning in autonomous systems. It fuses the precision of Symbolic AI with the adaptability of neural networks, enforcing provable safety and fault tolerance through a dedicated BEAM VM runtime.
🛡️ Intellectual Property & Licensing
Phronesis defines its IP across three layers:


Dual Licensing: AGPLv3 + Palimpsest 0.5
AGPLv3: Ensures the runtime and compiler remain free and open-source, even in networked deployments.
Palimpsest v0.5: Protects the philosophical core and benchmark suite, enabling open research while preserving ethical integrity.


Claimable IP: Novel Design & Semantic Architecture





Component
Novelty / Claim
Technical Significance




Hybrid Semantic Definition
Formal axiomatic + operational semantics
Guarantees trustworthiness and auditability


Probabilistic Types
BeliefFunction, ProbabilityDistribution as statically checked types
Solves symbol grounding between neural and symbolic layers


Metaiconic API
Modules return Expression
Enables introspection and self-correction


Map-Territory Mandate
Mandatory REPORT action flags model-reality inconsistencies
Enforces epistemological safety


BEAM/Raft Architecture
BEAM VM + Raft consensus for ethical loop execution




A. Safety & Dependability



Feature
Rationale




Strong Static Typing
Prevents runtime errors in safety-critical systems


BEAM VM Execution
Fault-tolerant, memory-safe, concurrent runtime for 24/7 operation


Sandboxing & Isolation
Containerized (Podman) for secure module execution


Formal Logic Integration
Supports ∀, ∃, ¬, ∪, ∩ for rigorous ethical reasoning
